so first of all you need to know which port(COM19,12,1...) the two arduinos are  
second you need to use inputs program and register the outputs 
third you put the outputs inside the remain program 
foruth you intiate the two program and wait 
please note that this rd program is not completed so the image  most  to be in red and black only 
hopefully it will be completed soon

FOR THOSE WHO ASKING ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IN RD PROGRAM 
def data(a):

    if a == az :
        return 0
    elif a == a255:
        return 255
    elif a == a36:
        return 36
    elif a == a28:
        return 28
    elif a == a237:
        return 237
    elif a == a256:
        return None
    elif a==a1:
        return 1
    elif a==a2:
        return 2
    else:
        return None
 there is no problem only the elif statments need to be completed  and it will work
